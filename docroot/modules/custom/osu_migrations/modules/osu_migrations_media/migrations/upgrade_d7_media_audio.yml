    # The tool configuring this migration must set source_base_path. It
    # represents the fully qualified path relative to which URIs in the files
    # table are specified. This can be a local file directory containing the
    # source site, e.g. /var/www/docroot, or the site address,
    # e.g. https://example.com. This value will be concatenated with the file
    # path (typically sites/default/files) and used as the source location for
    # the files.
    #
    # Suppose that the source files have been moved by other means to a location
    # on the destination site.
    # Source site:
    #   Location of files: /var/www/html/legacy/sites/default/files
    #   Public scheme: sites/default/files
    # In this example, source_base_path should be '/var/www/html/legacy'.
    #
    # Suppose that the source site is a multisite installation at
    # https://example.com, and you plan to copy the files from there.
    # Source site:
    #   Location of files: https://example.com/sites/example.com/files
    #   Public scheme: sites/example.com/files
    # In this example, source_base_path should be 'https://example.com'.
    #
    # See the configuration for the source_full_path property in the process
    # section below.
